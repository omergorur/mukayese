# List Compare
List Compare is a simple GUI application that allows you to compare two lists of text and find the common or different lines between them. It is written in Python and uses PyQt5 for creating the graphical user interface.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python 3 and PyQt5 installed on your system. You can install PyQt5 using pip:
```bash
pip install PyQt5
```
## Usage
To run the application, simply execute the main.py file:
```bash
python main.py
```

You will see a window with two input fields: Listem and Liste. Listem is where you enter the lines that you want to search for. Liste is where you enter the lines that you want to search in. You can also use the placeholder text as an example.

After entering the lists, you can click on one of the buttons below:

* Olanları Bul: This will find and display the lines that are present in both lists.
* Olmayanları Bul: This will find and display the lines that are present in Listem but not in Liste.
* Temizle: This will clear all the input and output fields.
The results will be shown in the Sonuç field below.
